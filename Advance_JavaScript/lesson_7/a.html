<!-- Lexical scope is a set of rules which determines where the var. can be accessed based on it's declaration -->

<!-- lexical scope is only a part of closure -->

 <!-- both are diff. concepts -->

 <!-- closure is a func. that can access the parent scope even after the parent func. has closed , since the inner func. remembers the place where it was declared. -->
