Non-blocking: While await pauses the execution of the async function, it doesn’t block the entire JavaScript runtime. Other code outside the async function can continue to run.

Perceived Delay: The “pause” caused by await is only within the async function. It allows other tasks to proceed, making your application more efficient.

We know that async await makes the code looks synchronous , but this is seen only within the async function , when we call await on line 1 insided async() then line 2 cant execute until the promise is resolved 
while other parts of your code outside the async() function can still run smoothly without any delay , in this way responsiveness is enhanced with the use of async await . 

note : that forEach doesn't works with async await
